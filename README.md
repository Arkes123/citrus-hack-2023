# Veritas 

## **Inspiration**

Inspired by the results of our last project of how social media creates political echo chambers. We wanted to analyze a different side of this topic and make use of more powerful machine learning models

## **Description**

Our project uses a recurrent neural network to analyze text patterns to asses how likely a inputted link to a news article is too contain bias/skewed information. Based on a certain set threshhold our model gives a value from 0 to 1 that shows how likley it will be bias/skewed. Our model was able to reach a 98% accuracy on our validation data however results varied depdning on the set threshold.

## **Tools Used** 
- Flask 
- Keras
- Numpy
